# DQMC-Hubbard Model
c++ implementation of DetQMC simulation applied to half-filled Hubbard model.
* Cyclic update (sweep back and forth).
* Stable sweeping process with high computational efficiency.
* Program works well in condition of moderate model parameters. 

# TODO:
* Real-frequency measurements, e.g. spin-spin correlation and momentum distribution
* Displaced Green's function and measurements
* Cmake file
* ...
