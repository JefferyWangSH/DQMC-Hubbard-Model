# DQMC-Hubbard Model
C++ implementation of DetQMC simulation applied to half-filled Hubbard model with repulsive interaction.
* Cyclic update (sweep back and forth).
* Stable sweeping process with high computational efficiency (linked to intel MKL library).
* Support equal-time and time-displaced measurements of physical quantities.
* Program works well in condition of moderate model parameters. 

# TODO
* Hubbard model with attractive electron-electron interaction.
* Spectral function of electrons.
