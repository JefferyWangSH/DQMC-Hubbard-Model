# DQMC-Hubbard Model
C++ implementation of DetQMC simulation applied to half-filled Hubbard model.
* Cyclic update (sweep back and forth).
* Stable sweeping process with high computational efficiency (linked to intel MKL library).
* Support equal-time and time-displaced measurements of physical quantities.
* Support attractive and repulsive hubbard interaction.
* Program works well in condition of moderate model parameters. 

# TODO
* Spectral function of electrons, e.g. Stochastic Analytic Continuation (SAC).
